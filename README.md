# BridgeVR

todo: add tags: VR, SteamVR, OpenVR, Linux, cross-platform, tracker

Emulate Vive trackers using only your smartphone(s).

BridgeVR does not require ARCore, ARKit, or any camera capabilities. It uses deep learning to estimate the 6DOF pose of your devices using only the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.

## Upcoming features - Help wanted

I plan to turn this project into a fully fledged VR streamer (such as ALVR or Virtual Desktop) with cross platform support and some innovative features. If you're into UI developement or Rust programming and want to help me you can join me on my [Discord server](todo link).
